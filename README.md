# haproxy-nightly-build

This repository provides the build scripts used to build packages available at https://software.opensuse.org/download/package?package=haproxy&project=home%3Awlallemand

The build of these packages is triggered upon a push on the https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy repository. Which result in extremely bleeding edge development packages.

Only Debian and Ubuntu packages are built for now.
